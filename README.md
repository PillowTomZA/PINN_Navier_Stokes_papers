# Research papers for Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)
**Work in Progress**

This repository is inspired by [Intelligent Design and Robus Learning Laboratory (IDRL)](https://github.com/idrl-lab/PINNpapers?tab=readme-ov-file).

This is structured to first help readers gain a general understanding of Physics-Informed Neural Network, with a targeted focus on fluid-mechanics-related papers later. Finally, links to different PINN packages available are shown in the last section.
